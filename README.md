# hello, this is a nft screenshotter. I made with puppeteer I allow anyone to distribute the software. None will be charged a fee. Oh and this is not finished yet so all it does is check if theres an image on the page opensea.io. Then it will set a variable to true. then an if sentence checks if there is an image then it will run the screenshotting prosess. which will then get the srcs of the imgs on the webpage. then it will set it to an array called imgs then it make a random item of the imgs array then it will go to opensea.io/therandomitem then it will screenshot it. but to detect the images you have to scroll until you see the connected. in the console.
